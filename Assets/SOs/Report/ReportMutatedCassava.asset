  sentences:
  - promt: Mutation
    fullSentence: "This cassava seems to have <b> mutated </b> from its base form\u2026
      We can still distinguish it from other plants though, but it still looks <b>
      different.</b>"
  - promt: Leaves
    fullSentence: The <b> mutated cassava </b> seem to have far fewer leaves and
      branches. Its leaves seem to have also gone white, similar to how an albino
      cassava plant would look like.
  - promt: Roots
    fullSentence: "<b>CassaThe plant\u2019s <b> roots </b> seem to have become more
      lumpy as well, almost becoming a huge stump, perhaps as a sign that the environment
      has become tougher to survive in or that it needs more resources to survive
      than the regular variant."
  - promt: Yellow Mark
    fullSentence: "The leaves seem to also have a yellow mark at the place where
      it\u2019s connected to the branches, perhaps it\u2019s a sign that the nutrients
      it\u2019s drawn aren\u2019t quite normal."
  - promt: Texture
    fullSentence: "The branches and leaves seem to almost have this too-smooth to
      be natural, <b> rubbery texture </b>. It also <b> smells like chemicals\u2026</b>"
