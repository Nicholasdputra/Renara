  title: Titan Arum
  sentences:
  - promt: Corpse
    fullSentence: The <b>Titan Arum</b> is nicknamed the <b>corpse flower</b> because
      it emits a strong pungent far reaching odor similar to rotting flesh to attract
      carrion beetles and flesh flies for pollination.
  - promt: Sumatra
    fullSentence: Native to the rainforests of <b>Sumatra</b>, the <b>Titan Arum</b>
      grows in the understory and relies on its dramatic scent and appearance to
      lure in the right pollinators.
  - promt: Inflorescene
    fullSentence: " The <b>Titan Arum</b> holds the record for the world\u2019s largest
      unbranched <b>inflorescence</b> (the floral arrangement of the plant), which
      can reach over 3 meters tall when fully bloomed."
  - promt: Bloom
    fullSentence: The <b>Titan Arum</b> blooms rarely, once every <b>7 to 10 years</b>
      and it only lasts for  <b>24 to 48 hours</b>, making each event a botanical
      spectacle.
  - promt: Heat
    fullSentence: During its bloom, the <b>Titan Arum</b> generates <b>heat</b>,
      mimicking the warmth of decaying animal flesh. This warmth also helps vaporize
      the compounds that induce a foul smell that it has, making the scent spread
      further and faster.
