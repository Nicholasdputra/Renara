  plantName: Rafflesia
  plantDescription: "A rare flower found in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It
    has no leaves, stems, or roots of its own and relies entirely on a host for nutrients
    and water. I reckon its rarity and uniqueness is the reason the JagaAlam company
    has chosen to cultivate this plant despite its foul smell that\u2019s reminiscent
    of rotting flesh."
